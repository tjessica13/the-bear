            <h3>About The Bear</h3>
            <p>
                The Bear inspired from the mind of the one, Carmen Berzatto, known for his position 
                at the best restaurant in the world in New York City. 
                Known for his exemplary dishes and stunning plating designs. 
                He takes this new step to opening a new fine-dining experience in his home town of Chicago. 
                The former restaurant named <i>The Beef</i> belonged to his older bother, Michael Berzatto, 
                who passed away 2 years ago and passed the family restaurant onto Carmen. 
                The Beef served the Chicago community 
                for years with its well loved sandwiches and still operate in a side-window style at The Bear.
